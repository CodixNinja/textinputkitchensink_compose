## Product Requirements Document (PRD): Text Input Showcase Mobile App

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the product requirements for a lightweight application designed to showcase common text input use cases found in top-ranked applications. The "Text Input Showcase" app will be built using Jetpack Compose and will demonstrate various text input scenarios without storing any user data.   This purpose will allow us to showcase best practices in text input design. The primary goal is to provide users with an interactive experience to explore different text input functionalities on their mobile devices highlighting platform-specific features on iOS.  **Furthermore, this application will explicitly demonstrate text input implementations for each scenario using Jetpack Compose.**

**2. Goals**

*   Demonstrate a variety of common text input scenarios found in popular applications.
*   Provide a user-friendly and interactive experience for exploring text input functionalities across mobile
*   Create a lightweight, self-contained application that does not store any user data.
*   Serve as a practical demonstration tool for developers, designers, and anyone interested in mobile text input best practices.

**3. Target Audience**

*   **Software Engineers:**  Engineers responsible for developing, maintaining, and improving text input implementations , with a particular interest in Jetpack Compose behavior.
*   ** Product Managers (Platform Fidelity & User Experience):** Product managers responsible for the overall quality and user experience of mobile apps and their text inputs, with a specific interest in ensuring platform fidelity for core features like text input.
*   **mobile app QA and Testing Team:** Teams responsible for testing and verifying the correctness and performance of an app’s text input features on iOS.

**4. Key Features**

*   **Scenario-Based Screens:** The app will feature distinct screens representing different common text input scenarios, **including a dedicated screen for Copy and Paste testing.**  Each screen will focus on a specific use case and widget style variant.
*   **Interactive Text Input Fields:** Users will be able to directly interact with text input fields on each screen, typing, **copying, and pasting text** and experiencing the functionalities.
*   **Platform Feature Demonstration:** The app will automatically leverage and demonstrate platform-specific text input features on iOS (e.g., Apple Writing Tools
*   **Clear Scenario Labeling:** Each screen will be clearly labeled with the use case for easy understanding.
*   **No Data Storage:** The application will operate entirely client-side and will not store any user-entered data locally or remotely.

**5. Use Case Scenarios**

The app will demonstrate the following text input scenarios, inspired by common use cases in top-ranked apps. 

*   **Login Screen:**
    *   Email/Username input field 
    *   Password input field 

*   **Purchase Screen (with Autofill):**
    *   Name input field 
    *   Address input fields, with separate inputs for different parts of the address (assume united states address)
    *   Credit Card Number input field
    *   Credit Card Expiry Date and CVV input fields

*   **Multi-Field Data Entry Form (Profile Creation):**
    *   Full Name input field 
    *   Username input field
    *   Bio/Description input field
    *   Location input field 

*   **Chat Screen:**
    *   Message input field 

*   **Search Bar:**
    *   Search input field 

*   **Review/Rating Screen:**
    *   Review Title input field
    *   Review Body input field
    *   Star rating component (separate from text input, but part of the review flow context)

*   **Settings Screen (Profile Editing):**
    *   Display Name input field 
    *   Email Address input field
    *   Phone Number input field

*   **Calendar Event Creation:**
    *   Event Title input field
    *   Event Description input field
    *   Location input field

*   **Social Media Post Creation:**
    *   Post Content input field 

*   **Copy and Paste Scenario:**
    *   **Source Text Area:** A large text area .
    *   **Destination Text Input Fields:**  
    *   Demonstrate platform-standard Copy and Paste behavior
        *   Using long-press context menus on mobile (iOS).
        *   Verify correct pasting of various text formats and lengths into different input field types.
        *   Test pasting from external applications into the app's text fields.
        *   Test copying from within the app and pasting into external applications (if feasible and relevant).

**6. Platform Considerations**

*   **iOS:**
    *   Automatically leverage and demonstrate **Apple Writing Tools:**
        *   QuickType suggestions
        *   Autocorrection and Autocaptialization
        *   Predictive text
        *   Text replacement features (if user configured)
        *   Potentially demonstrate **Live Text** input (if feasible and relevant to scenarios).
    *   Showcase **Autofill** from iCloud Keychain for relevant fields in the Purchase screen (if configured on the device).
    *   Utilize iOS-specific keyboard types and configurations where appropriate for each scenario.
    *   **Explicitly verify standard iOS Copy and Paste behavior using long-press context menus and system clipboard for both Material and Cupertino widget implementations.**


**7. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)**

*   **Clean and Intuitive Design:** The UI should be simple and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly access and understand each text input scenario.
*   **Clear Labeling:** Each screen and input field should be clearly labeled to indicate the use case for easy understanding and comparison.
*   **No Navigation Complexity:** Simple screen transitions to navigate between scenarios. A basic list or tab-based navigation could suffice.

**8. Technology Stack**

*   **Jetpack Compose:** 

**9. Out of Scope**

*   Backend server or database integration.
*   User authentication or account management within the app.
*   Complex UI animations or transitions beyond basic screen navigation.
*   Data persistence – no user data will be saved.
*   In-app suggestions or auto-complete functionality beyond what is provided by the native platform/browser text input systems.
*   Custom keyboard implementations.
*   Detailed accessibility feature implementation (basic accessibility considerations should be followed, but in-depth accessibility testing and optimization are out of scope for this lightweight demo).
*   Localization to multiple languages (English language only for this version).

**10. Success Metrics**

*   Completion of all planned use case scenarios within the application.
*   Successful demonstration of platform-specific text input features on iOS
*   Positive user feedback regarding the clarity and usefulness of the app as a demonstration tool 

**11. Release Criteria**

*   All outlined use case scenarios are implemented and functional across iOS
*   Basic testing on iOS to ensure stability and functionality for both Material and Cupertino widget implementations.
*   The application successfully demonstrates platform-specific text input features on iOS 
*   The application meets the "No Data Storage" requirement.
